# Heart Disease Prediction

**Description:**

The Heart Disease Prediction Dataset is a collection of health-related attributes for a group of patients, designed for predicting the likelihood of a heart attack. It includes features such as age, gender, exercise-induced symptoms, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The target variable indicates the probability of a heart attack (0 = less chance, 1 = more chance). This dataset is valuable for training machine learning models to aid in early heart disease detection and research in cardiology.

**Features:**
- Age
- Gender
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Number of Major Vessels
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

**Target:**
- Likelihood of a Heart Attack (0 = less chance, 1 = more chance)

**Usage:**
- Explore patterns and factors contributing to heart disease.
- Develop predictive models for early heart disease detection.
- Support clinical decision-making and public health initiatives.

**Dataset Source:**
The source of this dataset may include medical records, clinical studies, or surveys in the field of cardiology and healthcare.
